## Project Overview

This is the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project in the DL Nanodegree. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

| Assess the Human Face Detector                     | The submission returns the percentage of the first 100 images in the dog and human face datasets that include a detected, human face.                                                                 | Done    |<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>|
| Implement a Dog Detector                           | Use a pre-trained VGG16 Net to find the predicted class for a given image. Use this to complete a  dog_detector function below that returns True if a dog is detected in an image (and False if not). | In progress          |<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>|

### Additional
- [ ] Webapp using flask
- [ ] Overlay a Snapchat-like filter with dog ears on detected human heads.
- [ ] Added functionality: A single class with highest probability is shown. Added topk classes, if probability is less than a threshold.
- [ ] Experiment with multiple dog and human detectors.
